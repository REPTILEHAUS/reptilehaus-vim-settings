## Installation
- OSX

Depending on what OS you are using, if you use vim on Mac OSX you will find a hidden .vim folder in your home directory
the following should get you there cd ~/.vim then you can put these files directly in there to get the theme and settings.

-  Linux

Put the /etc/vim folder that will install these settings for all users, handy when you switch between your user account and root often.

To just install for a user follow the same advice as for OSX and of course you must have vim installed already
in order to use this theme/config.
